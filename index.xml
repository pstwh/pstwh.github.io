&lt;p>Several months ago, I conceived a project and brought it to fruition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core idea was to develop a lightweight, custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for reading license plates, specifically Brazilian ones. This system needed to be fast enough to run efficiently on a smartphone, operate offline (eliminating the need for a server), and ultimately support a mobile application. The app would capture images of passing vehicles, recognize their license plates, and send the extracted data to an API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There is no better time than now</title><link>https://pstwh.github.io/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 13:39:23 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://pstwh.github.io/posts/hello/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is no better time than now&lt;br>

So let us act, with all our might&lt;br>
Before it&amp;rsquo;s too late, and we take flight&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world is ours to shape and mold&lt;br>
But only if we are bold&lt;br>
So let us rise, and claim our place&lt;br>
Before our time runs out, and we face&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
