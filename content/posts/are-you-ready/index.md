Imagine the first human unable to beat a machine. How did they feel?

Let's start with the obvious:  
AI systems will inevitably exceed human capabilities in every domain. They'll be faster, more efficient, and their operational costs will be minimal—essentially just energy.


# Machines

Whether current AI systems will reach this level remains to be seen, but they are showing promising signs.

How will people react when they are consistently outperformed by machines?

Have you considered this? What if your greatest skill is inferior to a machine's?

What if *every* human skill is surpassed by machine capabilities?

We might take hours to read a book; a machine can do it in seconds.

Writing, even with tools like pens or keyboards, is a slow, mechanically moving your biological hands, physical process. Machines can generate text directly in seconds.

# Alternative

Some propose merging with machines. Then we can overcome our limited biological bodies. *Tried mixing vodka with water—it turned into vodka. Tried mixing it with juice—still vodka*. 

# Military

Sadly, the potential for these systems to threaten humanity is undeniable.

Military applications are inevitable.  Nations strive for dominance, and superior AI will become essential for defense.

This could lead to a catastrophic future.

# Cold Future

Have you ever imagined how is compete against something that is much smarter and can predict everything you can do?
What chance would you have?

Well, that is the future of AI.
