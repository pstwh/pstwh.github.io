&lt;p>Several months ago, I conceived a project and brought it to fruition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core idea was to develop a lightweight, custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for reading license plates, specifically Brazilian ones. This system needed to be fast enough to run efficiently on a smartphone, operate offline (eliminating the need for a server), and ultimately support a mobile application. The app would capture images of passing vehicles, recognize their license plates, and send the extracted data to an API.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
