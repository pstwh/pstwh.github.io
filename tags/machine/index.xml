How did they feel?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious:&lt;br>
AI systems will inevitably exceed human capabilities in every domain. They&amp;rsquo;ll be faster, more efficient, and their operational costs will be minimal—essentially just energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="machines">Machines&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Whether current AI systems will reach this level remains to be seen, but they are showing promising signs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How will people react when they are consistently outperformed by machines?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightweight License Plate Reading with Custom OCR</title><link>https://pstwh.github.io/posts/license-plates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 22:25:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://pstwh.github.io/posts/license-plates/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="idea">Idea&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Several months ago, I conceived a project and brought it to fruition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core idea was to develop a lightweight, custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for reading license plates, specifically Brazilian ones. This system needed to be fast enough to run efficiently on a smartphone, operate offline (eliminating the need for a server), and ultimately support a mobile application. The app would capture images of passing vehicles, recognize their license plates, and send the extracted data to an API.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
